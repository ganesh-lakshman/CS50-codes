        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p id="intro">	An aspiration to make accident free travelling happen made us think of a project like this. Our project mainly focusses on introducing a new device to vehicles. The z generation has seen how devices can connect with each other. From generation to generation network speeds have been increasing exponentially. From downloading an mp3 file to playing a multiplayer game with 100 different users in the world we have came a long way. The world is racing towards 5G and millimeter waves, that made us think of this idea. What if our vehicles can communicate with each other? What if they can communicate with us. What if they took over our responsibility to turn on signal light whenever it is needed? Yes, today is the future. Our project revolves on an idea which makes all these things within the pocket full of bucks. We develop a sensor which is mounted Infront of the vehicle which do have a camera sensor with some other sensors. The camera sensor captures the roads we are travelling and gives input to the system we develop; the system automates the signal lights if the vehicle goes in the wrong way. It can be done using machine learning. Our machine learning model before the mass release will undergo many trainings and testing. This is just the beginning. There are no limits in imagining what this machine is capable of doing. We can control the device using a mobile application. And guess what we can unlock our vehicle with our phone. Letâ€™s have a brief what do we achieve after all adding this device in all vehicles. accidents will be reduced at a greater rate. We can verify age while unlocking with phone. Cops will get information from our device; they can find evidences in a particular accident with the help of camera sensor. At a long run we are trying to achieve that these devices will communicate with each other that they indicate the driver whether he reaches his destination is safe to reach or not. We formulated all the possible outcomes that can go wrong with this project, but more on that another time. We can coordinate our device with google maps, as we know the more information these algorithms get the better, they perform. We wish our project could be the next basic thing a vehicle needs. The research we have done has taken many inputs and we would consider them in making a better product.
