); this is alll happended autmatically whe we imported data into response table
select [Email Address] from response;
select [Email Address] from response order by [Email Address];
select [Email Address], count([Email Address]) from response group by [Email Address] limit 10;
Email Address | count([Email Address])
sqlite> select [Email Address], count([Email Address]) as n from response group by [Email Address] order by n desc limit 10;

csv's are weakest form of data so we use relational databases
